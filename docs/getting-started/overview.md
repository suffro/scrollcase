# Scrollcase Overview

Scrollcase builds signed, portable Python environments, especially when a project needs to
include:

- a specific Python version;
- exact libraries and dependencies;
- application code;
- model weights or other assets;
- support for a specific platform or hardware accelerator;
- integrity checks and signed releases.

Its purpose is to avoid forcing each end user to install Python, native libraries, model dependencies, and model files manually.

The developer describes what the box should contain, runs a small number of commands, and
Scrollcase produces a box plus signed documents that another system may publish.

## Who Uses Scrollcase

There are two main roles:

<Tabs :titles="['The Developer','The Consuming Application']">
<Tab title="The Developer">

This is the person or team that builds and publishes the box.

---

The developer must:

- define the Python environment;
- specify the dependencies;
- provide model files or downloadable assets;
- choose the target platform;
- build the box;
- publish the generated files.

</Tab>
<Tab title="The Consuming Application">

This is the application that installs and uses the box.

---

The consuming application must:

- choose the correct box for the user's computer;
- download it;
- supply the local release, archive, and trust keys to a conforming consumer;
- own updates, activation, rollback, and removal policy.

The official Node, Python, and Rust consumers verify, safely extract, and run local caller-supplied
boxes. They do not select channels or download boxes.

## What Scrollcase Automates

Scrollcase automatically handles:

- creating the Python environment;
- installing dependencies;
- using the locked dependency versions;
- downloading declared assets;
- verifying asset sizes and hashes;
- making the environment relocatable;
- copying local code and files;
- running configured tests;
- creating the box;
- generating the ZIP archive;
- generating release manifests;
- calculating hashes;
- signing the release;
- preparing files for publication.

These operations happen during the build. The developer does not run them one by one.

## Initial Setup

The initial setup is usually performed once per project.

### 1. Install Scrollcase

Install Scrollcase in the repository using the method supported by the project.

### 2. Initialise the Workspace

Run:

```bash
scrollcase init
```

This creates the initial project structure and, after asking first and defaulting to yes, a
disposable runnable `example-box` for the native host, together with a concise `SCROLLCASE.md` and
TypeScript, Python, and Rust examples under `consumer-templates/` for running its built release
through the public APIs. Answer no, or pass `--no-example` to skip the question, when an empty
workspace without consumer examples is required; the project guide is still created.

### 3. Create a Project Scroll

Run:

```bash
scrollcase new scroll
```

This optional guided command asks four questions — the target, the box id, the upstream revision of
what is being packaged, and where boxes will be published — and creates one target-specific
`scroll.json`, its `pixi.toml` and a starter `self_test.py`, without overwriting existing source or
scroll files. The generated example can instead be used for the first walkthrough.

What the scroll then declares is added by command rather than by hand:

```bash
scrollcase add asset my-model https://…/model.safetensors   # downloads once, records size and hash
scrollcase add file my-model runtime/entrypoint.py
scrollcase add dep my-model onnxruntime
```

See [the CLI reference](/reference/cli#add) for `remove`, `edit scroll` and `refresh`.

### 4. Generate a Signing Key

Run:

```bash
scrollcase keygen
```

This creates the key pair used to sign releases.

The private key must be stored securely and must not be committed to the repository.

The public key must be distributed to the consuming application so that it can verify releases.

## Writing a Scroll

A scroll is the configuration that describes the box to build.

The developer specifies information such as:

- box name and version;
- target operating system;
- target architecture;
- hardware accelerator;
- Python version;
- local files to include;
- remote assets or model weights;
- expected file hashes;
- Python modules to import during tests;
- optional custom checks.

Conceptually, the scroll says:

```text
Box: model-x
Version: 1.0.0
Operating system: macOS
Architecture: Apple Silicon
Accelerator: Metal
Python: 3.14
Dependencies: PyTorch, NumPy, model-x library
Weights: URL, file size, SHA-256
Tests: import torch, import model_x
```

The scroll describes the desired result. It does not require the developer to implement the internal packaging process.

## Defining Dependencies

Dependencies are declared in the dependency file used by the scroll, normally through Pixi.

Conceptual example:

```toml
# pixi.toml

[dependencies]
python = "3.14.*"
pytorch = "2.*"
numpy = "2.*"
```

This file defines acceptable dependency versions.

It does not necessarily select the exact build of every package yet.

## Locking Dependency Versions

After defining the dependencies, run:

```bash
scrollcase lock model-x/macos-aarch64-metal
```

This generates a lock file containing the exact resolved dependency versions.
> This should normally be committed to the Git repository.

### When to Run `lock`

Run it:

- the first time the scroll is created;
- when a dependency changes;
- when upgrading a library;
- when changing the environment configuration.

It does not need to be rerun for every build if the dependencies have not changed.

## Checking the Configuration

Before building, the developer can run:

```bash
scrollcase doctor --scroll model-x/macos-aarch64-metal
```

This checks things such as:

- workspace configuration;
- scroll availability;
- Git repository state;
- required tools;
- whether the current machine can build the selected target;
- whether required files exist.

`doctor` helps detect configuration problems before starting a full build.

## First Build Workflow

The practical workflow for the first box is:

### 1. Initialise the Project

```bash
scrollcase init
```

### 2. Use the Example or Create a Project Scroll

`init` prints the exact example reference. To start a real one instead:

```bash
scrollcase new scroll
```

Define:

- box identity;
- target platform;
- Python version;
- dependencies;
- assets;
- tests.

### 3. Lock Dependencies

```bash
scrollcase lock model-x/macos-aarch64-metal
```

### 4. Commit the Configuration

Commit the scroll and lock file to Git.

### 5. Generate or Configure the Signing Key

```bash
scrollcase keygen
```

### 6. Build the Box

```bash
scrollcase build model-x/macos-aarch64-metal
```

### 7. Review the Output

The build typically produces:

- the box ZIP archive;
- the release document;
- the channel document;
- a publication-ready object structure.

### 8. Distribute the files (if needed)

Upload the generated files to the chosen distribution system, such as:

- object storage;
- static hosting;
- a release repository;
- a private server.

Scrollcase prepares the files, but does not upload them anywhere.

## Preparing and running a local box

The Node API at `scrollcase/consumer`, the Python package imported as `scrollcase_consumer`, and the
Rust crate `scrollcase-consumer` accept local release documents, archives, trust keys, and
destinations.
They share verification, safe extraction, re-attachment to a persistent root, opt-in installed
payload checking, execution, receipt, signal, cleanup, and on-demand asset semantics.

For a one-shot terminal run, the CLI is a thin wrapper over the Node consumer:

```bash
scrollcase run ./release.json --archive ./box.zip -- --help
```

It verifies first, runs the signed script or module without a shell, preserves the child result,
and removes its temporary extraction. See [Library APIs](/reference/api) and
[CLI Commands](/reference/cli#run).

An application that keeps an extracted box across restarts uses the attachment APIs rather than
serialising a receipt. It may verify the installed bytes independently through the signed payload
list, or with `scrollcase verify --extracted <dir>` for a manual check. See
[Distributing Boxes](/guides/distributing-boxes#keeping-an-extracted-box-across-restarts).

## What Happens During `build`

From the developer's perspective, the build is a single command:

```bash
scrollcase build model-x/macos-aarch64-metal
```

Scrollcase then performs the internal packaging steps automatically.

The developer does not need to:

- install Python manually inside the box;
- copy libraries one by one;
- download every asset manually;
- repair environment paths manually;
- create the ZIP archive;
- calculate hashes;
- write release manifests;
- sign every file manually.

The internal complexity remains inside the tool.

## Publishing and distribution

Scrollcase is not a hosting/distribution service.

After the build, the developer can publish the generated files on its own.

This can be done:

- manually;
- with a script;
- through CI/CD;
- with GitHub Actions;
- through an object-storage deployment pipeline.

A typical flow could be:

```text
Scrollcase builds the files
↓
the deployment system uploads them
↓
the consuming application downloads them
```

## Update Workflow

After the initial setup, publishing a new version requires fewer steps.

### Case 1: Only Code or Included Files Change

1. update the code;
2. increase the version;
3. run the build;
4. publish the new files.

```bash
scrollcase build model-x/macos-aarch64-metal
```

### Case 2: Dependencies Change

1. update the dependency configuration;
2. regenerate the lock file;
3. review the result;
4. run the build;
5. publish the new files.

```bash
scrollcase lock model-x/macos-aarch64-metal
scrollcase build model-x/macos-aarch64-metal
```

### Case 3: Model Weights Change

1. update the asset URL, file size, and hash in the scroll;
2. increase the version;
3. run the build;
4. publish the new release.

## Supporting Multiple Platforms

A box is specific to one target.

Examples include:

- macOS Apple Silicon with Metal;
- macOS Apple Silicon with CPU only;
- Linux x86_64 with CPU;
- Linux x86_64 with CUDA;
- Windows x86_64 with CPU;
- Windows x86_64 with CUDA.

Supporting several targets requires several builds and usually separate target-specific scrolls or configurations.

The workflow becomes:

```text
macOS scroll
↓
macOS build

Linux CPU scroll
↓
Linux CPU build

Linux CUDA scroll
↓
Linux CUDA build

Windows scroll
↓
Windows build
```

Each build must run on a machine compatible with the target.

This is one of the main sources of complexity when supporting a large platform matrix.

## What the Consuming Application Must Implement

Scrollcase creates the box, but it does not implement installation inside the final application.

The consuming application must handle:

1. detecting the operating system and architecture;
2. detecting the available accelerator when relevant;
3. choosing the correct channel and release;
4. downloading the manifests;
5. verifying the signatures;
6. checking runtime requirements;
7. downloading the ZIP archive;
8. verifying its size and hash;
9. extracting the box;
10. downloading optional on-demand assets;
11. starting the correct Python runtime or script;
12. handling updates, errors, and uninstallation.


## What the End User Does

An ideal could be:

```text
the user access the application that uses Scrollcase
↓
the user selects a feature or model
↓
the application selects the correct box
↓
the user press install (or a similar call to action)
↓
the application downloads it, verifies it and extracts it
↓
the application starts it when requested
```

## Is Scrollcase Complicated?

### Conceptually

The mental model is simple:

```text
describe the environment
↓
lock the versions
↓
build the box
↓
publish the files
```

For a single box with common dependencies, the workflow can be fairly straightforward.

### In Practice

The complexity increases when the project includes:

- difficult native libraries;
- strict version requirements;
- old scientific packages;
- dependencies unavailable through supported channels;
- several operating systems;
- several CUDA versions;
- very large model files;
- complex scientific validation;
- advanced signing and release pipelines.

In most cases, the complexity comes more from the Python environment and the model than from Scrollcase itself.

## What Scrollcase Actually Simplifies

Scrollcase removes much of the repetitive work required to turn a Python environment into a distributable product.

Without a tool like this, the developer would have to manage:

- environment creation;
- exact dependency versions;
- relocatability;
- native dependencies;
- verified downloads;
- manifests;
- signatures;
- hashes;
- release structure;
- tests;
- distribution conventions.

With Scrollcase, these concerns are collected into a scroll and a small number of commands.
