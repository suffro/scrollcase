description: Install the Scrollcase CLI, and the pixi + conda-pack toolchain real builds need.
---

# Installation

Scrollcase is a Node.js command line tool. The CLI itself has no native dependencies; building a
box for real additionally needs `pixi` and `conda-pack` on the machine that builds — and
`scrollcase init` can install those for you, after asking.

The Python and Rust consumers are separate distributions. Installing `scrollcase` through npm
provides neither the `scrollcase_consumer` Python module nor the `scrollcase-consumer` crate.

## Requirements at a glance

| You want to… | You need |
| --- | --- |
| Scaffold, audit, keygen, or verify without a self-test | Node.js ≥ 20 |
| Resolve a lock (`lock`) | Node.js ≥ 20 and `pixi` at the scroll's pinned version |
| Build a box (`build`) | Node.js ≥ 20, pinned `pixi`, conda-pack, and a local key or external signer |
| Verify with `--self-test` | The same OS and architecture the box targets |
| Consume an existing local box from Python | Python ≥ 3.10 and `scrollcase-consumer` |
| Consume an existing local box from Rust | Rust ≥ 1.88 and the `scrollcase-consumer` crate |

Auditing, key generation, signing primitives, and verification need no dependency toolchain.
`lock` invokes pixi; `build` invokes both pixi and conda-pack.

## Install the CLI

```sh
npm install -g scrollcase
```

Check the install:

```sh
scrollcase --version
```

## Install consumers

### Install the Node consumer

The Node consumer needs the scrollcase package to be installed, therefor if you already installed the scrollcase CLI, you do not have to install anything else, otherwise [install the CLI](#install-the-cli) first.

The import name:

```js
import { runBox } from 'scrollcase/consumer';
```

The Node consumer prepares and executes release documents and archives already present on the local machine. Every path and trust anchor comes from the caller. It never selects a channel, downloads an archive or asset, installs globally, updates an existing destination, or applies application lifecycle policy.

### Install the Python consumer

A Python application that only verifies and runs caller-supplied local boxes does not need the
Scrollcase CLI or a Node.js runtime:

```sh
python -m pip install scrollcase-consumer
```

The import name uses an underscore:

```python
from scrollcase_consumer import run_box
```

This package does not build or download boxes. The publishing project builds the box; the consuming
application supplies the local release document, archive, and trusted public key.

When `scrollcase init` creates the consumer templates, it can perform this installation for you.
It asks separately from the build toolchain and can use either PyPI with pip or conda-forge:

```sh
conda install --yes --channel conda-forge scrollcase-consumer
```

The TypeScript and Rust templates have their own optional prompts. If approved, `init` runs npm from
the same project root to install `scrollcase`, `typescript`, and `tsx`, and Cargo against the
generated Rust manifest to add `scrollcase-consumer`. `init` collects every answer before starting
any installation. If pip reports a PEP 668 externally managed interpreter, `init`
automatically retries as a user install, keeping package files outside the managed Python prefix.
If you select conda-forge but the `conda` command is unavailable, it asks whether to continue with
PyPI instead.

<Tab title="Rust">

### Install the Rust consumer

A Rust application — a Tauri desktop client, a native service — consumes local boxes without a Node
or Python runtime:

```sh
cargo add scrollcase-consumer
```

The crate name uses a hyphen and the import name an underscore:

```rust
use scrollcase_consumer::run::run_box;
```

Like the Python package it builds and downloads nothing. When `scrollcase init` creates its
non-publishable template crate, it can run the same `cargo add` command against that crate's own
manifest after asking `Install scrollcase-consumer for Rust?`. If Cargo is not installed, `init`
keeps the template, skips the question, and prints the command to run later instead of failing.

## Let Scrollcase install the toolchain

`scrollcase init` initializes a workspace and then **offers** to install what is missing:

```text
This project needs pixi and conda-pack to build a box.
Install them into /work/my-project/.scrollcase/toolchain? [Y/n]
```

Nothing is downloaded before you answer, and the interactive default is yes. Say yes (or press
Enter) and Scrollcase installs
both **inside the project**, under `.scrollcase/toolchain/` — nothing is added to `PATH`, nothing
is installed system-wide, and deleting the directory undoes it. Later commands find the tools
there on their own.

What you get is verified, not just fetched:

- the release archive's SHA-256 is checked against the checksum pixi publishes beside it, and a
  mismatch aborts before anything is installed;
- the verified digest is recorded under `toolchain` in `scrollcase.config.json`, so the next
  machine — a teammate's, a CI runner's — is checked against the value **your project committed**
  rather than whatever the server offers that day;
- the generated example and managed toolchain share the same pixi pin; every project scroll created
  by `scrollcase new scroll` still declares its own exact `pixiVersion`.

For unattended setups, answer up front:

```sh
scrollcase init --install-toolchain      # install without asking
scrollcase init --no-install-toolchain   # never install; just report what is missing
scrollcase init --no-example             # initialize without example-box
```

With no terminal to prompt — CI, a pipe — Scrollcase never installs anything and simply reports
what is missing. Silence is not consent.

::: tip Pin the version you want
`--pixi-version 0.73.0` uses exactly that release for both the generated example and an approved
managed install. With `--no-example`, omitting the flag uses the installed release or newest
available release for the workspace toolchain. `new scroll` pins the pixi it finds installed, since
`build` refuses any other; pass `--pixi-version` to pin a different one.
:::

## Install the toolchain yourself

If you would rather manage the toolchain — a shared machine, a company mirror, an existing pixi
install — Scrollcase is happy to use it. Install both tools and skip the step above.

### pixi

[pixi](https://pixi.sh) solves and installs the conda-forge environment. Every scroll **pins the
exact pixi version** it was locked with (`pixiVersion` in `scroll.json`), and Scrollcase refuses
to run `lock` or `build` with any other version — a different resolver can select different
packages and silently change the box.

Install it following the [pixi installation docs](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation), for
example:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

If you need a specific release to match a scroll's pin, download the matching release from the
pixi GitHub releases page, or use the version-pinned form of the install script documented by
pixi.

### conda-pack

[conda-pack](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/) turns the installed environment into a
relocatable tree. The recommended install is through pixi itself:

```sh
pixi global install "conda-pack==0.9.2"
```

Scrollcase's managed installer uses this exact release. `conda-pack --version` currently reports
`0.0.0` regardless of the installed package release, so Scrollcase can pin what it installs but
cannot reliably validate the version of an executable supplied through a flag, environment
variable, or `PATH`.

## Point Scrollcase at the toolchain

If `pixi` and `conda-pack` are on `PATH`, nothing more is needed. If they live elsewhere — a
dedicated toolchain directory, a CI cache — point Scrollcase at them per invocation:

```sh
scrollcase build my-box/linux-x86_64-cpu \
  --pixi /opt/toolchain/bin/pixi \
  --conda-pack /opt/toolchain/bin/conda-pack
```

or once, through the environment:

```sh
export SCROLLCASE_PIXI=/opt/toolchain/bin/pixi
export SCROLLCASE_CONDA_PACK=/opt/toolchain/bin/conda-pack
```

A `--pixi` / `--conda-pack` flag wins over the environment variable, which wins over the
project-local toolchain, which wins over `PATH`.

## Upgrade Pixi intentionally

Changing resolver versions is a dependency change, not a tool repair:

1. edit the scroll's `pixiVersion` to the intended release;
2. initialise or install that exact version with explicit consent, or point `--pixi` at it;
3. run `scrollcase lock <scroll>` and review the new `pixi.lock`;
4. run `scrollcase audit <scroll>` and review/write any intentional licence change;
5. commit the scroll, lock, audit, and toolchain digest;
6. rebuild the box.

Do not delete the pin and accept whichever resolver happens to be newest.

## Check the machine

`doctor` reports whether this machine can build, and says exactly what to do about anything
missing. It only reads; it never writes and never touches the network.

```sh
scrollcase doctor --pixi-version 0.73.0
# or take the required pixi version from a scroll:
scrollcase doctor --scroll my-box/linux-x86_64-cpu
```

Sample output:

```text
ok    workspace   config /work/my-project/scrollcase.config.json
ok    scrolls     /work/my-project/scrolls
ok    git         HEAD 3f9c2ab17d42
ok    pixi        pixi at 0.73.0
ok    conda-pack  conda-pack
```

Every check reports rather than aborting at the first failure, so a machine missing both tools
learns both in one run.

::: tip Builds are native
A box is always built on the OS and architecture it ships for: macOS arm64 boxes on an Apple
Silicon Mac, Linux x86_64 boxes on Linux, Windows boxes on Windows. There is no cross-building —
the self-test runs the box's own interpreter, which only proves anything on matching hardware.
