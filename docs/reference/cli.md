# CLI Commands

```text
scrollcase <command> [options]
scrollcase -v | --version
```

Nine verbs: `init`, `new`, `doctor`, `keygen`, `lock`, `audit`, `build`, `verify`, `run`.
`scrollcase help` (or no command) prints the full usage text.
`scrollcase -v` and `scrollcase --version` print only the installed package version and do not
require a workspace.

**Flag syntax.** Flags accept `--name value` or `--name=value`; a bare `--name` means `true`.

**Exit convention.** Every failure, anywhere in the pipeline, exits non-zero with a single
`scrollcase: <message>` line on stderr — safe to rely on from shell scripts and CI.

**Workspace flags** (`--config`, `--project-root`, `--scrolls-dir`, `--build-dir`, `--out-dir`,
`--keys-dir`, `--toolchain-dir`) apply to every command and are resolved before anything else runs. They are
documented in [Workspace Configuration](/reference/configuration).

## Scroll arguments and target selection

`lock`, `audit` and `build` accept an exact nested reference:

```sh
scrollcase build hello-box/macos-aarch64-metal
```

They also accept a box ID, with an optional target flag:

```sh
scrollcase build hello-box --target macos-aarch64-metal
```

With only `hello-box`, a terminal shows a navigable target menu for the scrolls under
`scrolls/hello-box/`: use ↑/↓ and Enter. Exactly one target matching the host OS and architecture is
offered as the default; on macOS, Metal is preferred when both CPU and Metal are available. With no
terminal, the same default is selected and reported; any other ambiguous selection fails and tells
the caller to pass `--target`. v2 accepts only the nested
`scrolls/<boxId>/<targetId>/scroll.json` layout.

## `init`

Initialize a workspace and a fixed, disposable `example-box` for the native host. The example is a
complete runnable v2 scroll: Metal on Apple Silicon and CPU on Linux or Windows. It is created
through the normal validated authoring path and never overwritten. It also includes
`consumer-templates/run-box.ts` and `consumer-templates/run_box.py`, which demonstrate the public
Node and Python consumer APIs against a caller-supplied local release and include their setup
commands. If no `package.json` exists, it creates a private one with `"type": "module"`; an
existing package file is never changed. A concise, linked `SCROLLCASE.md` is always created unless
one already exists. Pass `--no-example` to omit `example-box`, the consumer examples, and the Node
package file while retaining the workspace guide.

When it generated the consumer templates, `init` separately asks whether to install their
Node/TypeScript dependencies and whether to install the Python consumer from PyPI with pip or
conda-forge with conda. It also offers to install `pixi` and `conda-pack` if they are missing. Each
question is separated by a blank line, and every answer is collected before the first installer
runs. If conda-forge is selected but `conda` cannot start, another question offers PyPI instead.
Without a terminal every answer defaults to no.

```sh
scrollcase init [--pixi-version <version>]
                [--no-example]
                [--install-toolchain | --no-install-toolchain]
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--pixi-version` | example pin | Use this exact pixi release for the example and managed toolchain |
| `--no-example` | off | Initialize an empty workspace without `example-box` |
| `--install-toolchain` | ask | Install missing tools without prompting |
| `--no-install-toolchain` | ask | Never install; just report what is missing |

The final guidance names the example's exact lock command and points to `scrollcase new scroll` for
real project metadata. With `--no-example`, it is simply `Next: scrollcase new scroll`. Target and
product flags passed to `init` are rejected with the same remedy instead of being silently ignored.

### The toolchain step

With neither flag and a terminal attached, `init` prompts, defaulting to **no**. Without a
terminal — CI, a pipe — it never installs and simply reports what is missing: silence is not
consent.

When you agree, `init`:

1. resolves the pixi version — `--pixi-version`, else the example's repository pin; with
   `--no-example`, the installed pixi's or newest release;
2. downloads the release for this host and checks its SHA-256 against the checksum pixi publishes
   beside it. **A mismatch aborts and installs nothing**;
3. installs pixi into the workspace's toolchain directory, then uses it to run
   `pixi global install "conda-pack==0.9.2"` with `PIXI_HOME` pointing there, so both land in the
   project;
4. records the verified pixi digest and the conda-pack version under `toolchain` in
   `scrollcase.config.json`, so later pixi installs are checked against the committed digest — see
   [Workspace Configuration](/reference/configuration#toolchain);
5. keeps each scroll's own `pixiVersion`; the generated example and managed toolchain use the same
   resolved pin.

Nothing is added to `PATH` and nothing is installed system-wide; later commands find the tools
because [tool discovery](#tool-discovery) looks in the toolchain directory. Deleting
`.scrollcase/toolchain/` undoes the whole thing.

The consumer prompts are independent of this managed build toolchain. Accepting the TypeScript
prompt runs npm in the project root to install `scrollcase`, `typescript`, and `tsx`. Accepting the
Python prompt installs `scrollcase-consumer` with either pip or conda-forge. For a PEP 668
externally managed interpreter, `init` retries as a user-scoped installation and keeps package
files outside the managed prefix. The conda-forge path checks Conda before installation and offers
the PyPI fallback when it is missing.

The example follows Scrollcase's supported box target matrix. On another host, initialize with
`--no-example`. Toolchain-only setup can still use any host for which pixi publishes a build.

## `new`

Create one complete `scrolls/<boxId>/<targetId>/` input. With a terminal, free-form values are
prompted and target, weights, execution kind, and script source use navigable menus. Without a
terminal, every material value must be supplied explicitly and missing input fails before anything
is written.

```sh
scrollcase new scroll
scrollcase new scroll \
  --target linux-x86_64-cpu \
  --box-id example-model \
  --model-id example-org-example-model \
  --runtime-id example-runtime \
  --version 1.0.0 \
  --scroll-version 1.0.0 \
  --source-revision upstream-v1 \
  --python-version 3.11.15 \
  --pixi-version 0.73.0 \
  --min-host-app-version 1.0.0 \
  --asset-base-url https://assets.example.org/boxes \
  --weights embed \
  --execution library-only
```

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--target` | Complete canonical target; CUDA IDs include the ABI, such as `linux-x86_64-cuda12.4` |
| `--box-id` | Box identity and parent directory |
| `--model-id` | Packaged model identity |
| `--runtime-id` | Runtime identity |
| `--version` | Box version |
| `--scroll-version` | Version of the authoring input |
| `--source-revision` | Upstream revision recorded in provenance |
| `--python-version` | Python dependency version written into `pixi.toml` |
| `--pixi-version` | Exact resolver version required by `lock` and `build` |
| `--min-host-app-version` | Required compatibility floor |
| `--max-host-app-version-exclusive` | Optional compatibility ceiling |
| `--min-macos-version` | Optional macOS floor |
| `--min-ram-gb` | Optional positive RAM requirement |
| `--min-nvidia-driver-version` | Optional NVIDIA driver floor |
| `--asset-base-url` | Base URL copied into built release metadata |
| `--weights` | `embed` or `on-demand` |
| `--execution` | `python-script`, `python-module`, or `library-only` |
| `--script` | Existing project-relative Python script |
| `--generate-script` | Generate a minimal starter instead of using an existing script |
| `--script-destination` | Safe payload path, default `entrypoint.py` |
| `--generated-script-path` | Project path for the generated source; defaults to `box-entrypoints/<boxId>/<targetId>/entrypoint.py` |
| `--module` | Strict dotted Python module name |
| `--default-args` | JSON array of default application arguments |

For `python-script`, choose exactly one of `--script` and `--generate-script`. Scrollcase hashes the
exact source bytes into `localFiles`, refuses traversal and non-regular sources, and never
overwrites an existing source or scroll. Generated defaults are grouped by both box and target;
`library-only` omits execution metadata.

Execution metadata is copied into the signed release and `box.json`. Before archiving, the builder
requires a script to remain a regular payload file or a dotted module to be discoverable in the
built environment without importing it. Library-only scrolls omit the field.

## `doctor`

Report whether this machine can build a box. Reads only; never writes. Each failing check prints
a remedy, and all checks run even when an early one fails.

```sh
scrollcase doctor [--scroll <name>] [--target <targetId>] [--pixi-version <version>]
                  [--pixi <path>] [--conda-pack <path>]
```

Checks: the workspace resolution, the scrolls directory, being inside a git checkout, pixi at the
required version (from `--pixi-version` or `--scroll`; skipped when neither is given), and
conda-pack. The managed installer pins conda-pack 0.9.2; because its `--version` output is not
reliable, `doctor` can only prove that an externally supplied conda-pack executable runs. Exits
non-zero if any check fails.

## `keygen`

Create a local ed25519 signing key pair: a private PEM written with owner-only permissions, and a
public key JSON file used as the trust anchor by `verify`.

```sh
scrollcase keygen [--key-id <id>] [--force]
                  [--private-key <path>] [--public-key <path>]
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--key-id` | `scrollcase-<first 16 hex of key hash>` | Identifier recorded in every signature |
| `--force` | off | Overwrite an existing key. Guarded because rotating silently would invalidate every previously signed document |
| `--private-key` | `<keys>/signing-private.pem` | Where the private key is written |
| `--public-key` | `<keys>/signing-public.json` | Where the public key file is written |

See [Signing & Key Custody](/guides/signing-and-custody) for rotation and external signers.
`--force` is not a rotation workflow or a safe way to repair mismatched paths: it can overwrite
the only copy of an established signing identity.

## `lock`

Resolve the scroll's `pixi.toml` into a fully pinned `pixi.lock`, written next to the manifest.
Run by a human when dependencies change; the lock is committed and reviewed, and `build` then
only installs from it. Requires pixi at the scroll's pinned version.

```sh
scrollcase lock [<scroll>] [--target <targetId>] [--pixi <path>]
```

The manifest itself pins the channels and the single target platform, so resolution does not
depend on the machine doing it.

When `<scroll>` is omitted in an interactive terminal, Scrollcase discovers every valid nested
scroll in the workspace and presents their complete `<boxId>/<targetId>` references in a navigable
menu. A non-interactive caller must provide the reference explicitly.

## `audit`

The dependency licence inventory, derived from the committed `pixi.lock` without building
anything. The lock carries an SPDX licence per package; a package **without a declared licence
fails the parse outright** — an unlicensed dependency is a legal problem, not a reporting gap.

```sh
scrollcase audit <scroll> [--target <targetId>] [--write] [--namespace <ns>]
```

Two modes:

- **Check (default).** If the scroll declares a `condaDependencyLicenseAudit` path, the computed
  inventory is compared byte-for-byte against that reviewed file and any difference fails. This
  is what `build` enforces too, so licence review happens when dependencies change — not at the
  end of a multi-gigabyte build.
- **Write (`--write`).** Write the inventory to the scroll's declared path, for a human to review
  and commit. Writing is explicit because silently overwriting the reviewed file is exactly how
  an unreviewed licence change would slip through.

`--namespace` sets the namespace of the inventory's `kind`
(`<namespace>.dependency-license-audit`, default `scrollcase.box`).

Output is a per-licence package count, for example:

```text
23 packages for hello-box-macos-aarch64-metal (macos-aarch64-metal)
    9  MIT
    4  Apache-2.0
    ...
```

## `build`

Turn a scroll into a signed box: install the locked environment, pack and relocate it, stage
assets, prune, audit licences, self-test with the box's own interpreter, run the optional
[parity gate](/guides/accelerator-parity), archive deterministically, and sign a release document
plus a channel pointer. The full pipeline is narrated in
[Architecture](/concepts/architecture).

```sh
scrollcase build [<scroll>] [--target <targetId>]
                 [--channel <name>] [--weights embed|on-demand]
                 [--asset-base-url <url>] [--namespace <ns>] [--allow-dirty]
                 [--pixi <path>] [--conda-pack <path>]
                 [--private-key <path>] [--public-key <path>] [--signer-command <cmd>]
```

As with `lock`, omitting `<scroll>` in an interactive terminal opens the workspace-wide scroll
menu. CI and other non-interactive callers must always provide it explicitly.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--target` | ask when a box has several scrolls | Canonical target scroll to build |
| `--channel` | `beta` | Channel the signed pointer names. The v2 vocabulary is closed to `nightly`, `beta`, and `stable` |
| `--weights` | scroll's `weights`, else `embed` | The navigable menu offers `embed`, which packs assets into the archive (works air-gapped), and `on-demand`, which leaves them out for the caller to materialize; consumers verify them before execution |
| `--asset-base-url` | scroll's `assetBaseUrl` | Base URL the signed documents point at; one of the two must be set |
| `--namespace` | `scrollcase.box` | Document `kind` namespace — a project with boxes already in the field keeps emitting its own |
| `--allow-dirty` | off | Permit a build from an uncommitted tree; recorded as `sourceTreeDirty: true` in the box |
| `--signer-command` | none | Sign through an external command instead of the local key — see [Signing & Key Custody](/guides/signing-and-custody#external-signers) |

Before starting the environment build, Scrollcase checks that signing is ready. If both default
local key files are absent, it fails immediately with `Signing keys not found. Run scrollcase
keygen before building.` The build command never generates identity material itself. An incomplete
pair is never overwritten; an external signer instead requires its trusted public key to be
present.

A successful build ends with a compact relative-path summary: you can distribute the two immutable files
under `boxes/<boxId>/<version>/<targetId>/` and the signed pointer at
`channels/<boxId>/<channel>/<targetId>.json`. The individual content-addressed filenames remain
unchanged.

`build` refuses to run when: the workspace is not a git checkout; the tree is dirty and
`--allow-dirty` is absent; `pixi.lock` is missing; the pixi on hand is not the scroll's pinned
version; or the host OS/architecture does not match the target — boxes are proven on the hardware
they ship for. Dirty detection includes untracked files and excludes files ignored by Git.

Outputs, under the workspace's `dist` directory:

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `boxes/<boxId>/<version>/<targetId>/<archive sha256>.zip` | The box archive |
| `boxes/<boxId>/<version>/<targetId>/<document sha256>.release.json` | The signed release document committing to the archive by size and SHA-256 |
| `channels/<boxId>/<channel>/<targetId>.json` | The signed channel pointer |

`boxes/` is uploaded as it stands — the paths are the keys the signed documents already point to.
`channels/` is separate because a channel outlives any one version. See
[Distributing Boxes](/guides/distributing-boxes).

## `verify`

Run the format checks a consumer can repeat against a signed release document and its archive,
before anything is published.

```sh
scrollcase verify <release.json> [--archive <path>] [--self-test] [--env-report] [--env-report-values]
scrollcase verify <release.json> --extracted <dir> [--env-report] [--env-report-values]
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--archive` | `<archive.sha256>.zip` next to the release document | The archive to check |
| `--self-test` | off | Extract to a temporary directory and import the declared modules with the box's own interpreter. Only runs on a matching native host |
| `--extracted` | off | Verify an existing extracted payload against the signed payload digest. Cannot be combined with `--archive` or `--self-test` |
| `--env-report` | off | Expand the diagnostic from the compact relevant subset to every resolved variable name; inherited host values remain masked |
| `--env-report-values` | off | Expand the report and reveal inherited host values. Use deliberately: logs may contain secrets |
| `--public-key` | `<keys>/signing-public.json` | Trusted key file (a single key, or a `{ "keys": [...] }` bundle) |

Checks, in order: envelope payload hash and at least one trusted signature; release kind; coherent
target and entry point; archive size and SHA-256; safe entry names; recursively equal shared
`box.json` fields (identity/version, full target, entry point, cache subdirectory, declared
environment, consumer self-test, weights/assets, and provenance); and the declared interpreter. `--self-test`
additionally requires a matching native host, extracts to a temporary directory, checks logical
payload size, and runs the signed import check. It does not repeat scroll-only `pythonCode` or file
assertions, which are builder-only checks.

After validating the command arguments, `verify` prints a blank line and `Verifying box` (or
`Verifying extracted payload`) before it starts reading and hashing the supplied bytes, so a long
verification gives immediate terminal feedback.

Every verification result carries a structured environment snapshot in the library. The CLI stays
silent on a plain verification unless a report flag is present; `--self-test` prints the compact
report automatically when the release declares variables, conflicts exist, or inherited variables
such as `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONHOME`, `PYTHONSTARTUP`, `PYTHONBREAKPOINT`, `LD_PRELOAD`, or
`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` can change which code runs. The snapshot is diagnostic output from this
consumer and this process, not evidence signed into the box.

`--extracted` takes the archive path out of this flow and delegates to the Node consumer's payload
verification operation. It verifies the signed release document and the payload list carried by
`<dir>`, then checks every file and symbolic link named by that list. Files added after installation
are ignored. This is an explicit integrity check at one moment; it does not attach or execute the
box, and it does not protect the directory from later changes.
Modes and modification times are outside the commitment. The build collector also excludes
`__pycache__` directories and `*.pyc` files, so this command makes no assertion about compiled
Python caches.

## `run`

Verify and execute one caller-supplied local release through `scrollcase/consumer`:

```sh
scrollcase run <release.json> [--archive <box.zip>] [--env-report] [--env-report-values] -- [application args]
```

The command prints a blank line and `Preparing box for execution` immediately after validating its
arguments, then performs the same signature, schema, archive, safe-entry, manifest-agreement,
installed-size, interpreter, and execution checks as the Node consumer. It extracts into a private
temporary directory and prints the signed box ID, version, target and execution kind after another
blank separator, then attaches terminal stdio and runs the declared script or module with the box's
own Python. Every status write is flushed before the interpreter starts, so it cannot appear after
the box's own output. Signed `defaultArgs` come first; every string after `--` follows unchanged,
without a shell.

The compact environment report appears automatically when it has something relevant to say.
`--env-report` expands it to every variable name and provenance source while keeping inherited host
values masked; `--env-report-values` explicitly reveals those values and implies the full report.
The signed declaration wins over inherited and caller values. Nothing is filtered.

The child exit code becomes the Scrollcase exit code. `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGHUP` are forwarded
to the child; after the child terminates, the temporary box is removed and the CLI terminates by the
same signal. Temporary cleanup also runs after verification failure, spawn failure, normal exit, and
non-zero exit.

`run` is intentionally local:

- it never selects a channel or downloads an archive;
- `--archive` names bytes already present on disk, defaulting to the content hash beside the release;
- `--public-key` uses the same trusted key file or bundle as `verify`;
- it refuses library-only releases, non-native targets, and missing or mismatched on-demand assets;
- it never installs persistently, updates an existing box, or owns application lifecycle policy.

Because one-shot `run` does not download or provide an asset-materialization step, an on-demand box
with required assets fails clearly. A caller that already owns those bytes uses
`verifyAndExtractBox`, materializes each signed descriptor under the prepared root, and then calls
`runExtractedBox`.

## Tool discovery {#tool-discovery}

Every command that needs `pixi` or `conda-pack` resolves it the same way, highest precedence
first:

1. **The explicit flag** — `--pixi <path>`, `--conda-pack <path>`.
2. **The environment** — `SCROLLCASE_PIXI`, `SCROLLCASE_CONDA_PACK`.
3. **The project's own toolchain** — `<toolchain>/bin/`, if the executable is there. This is where
   `init` installs, which is why nothing has to be added to `PATH` afterwards.
4. **`PATH`** — the bare `pixi` / `conda-pack` name.

`build` and `lock` additionally require pixi to be at the exact version the scroll pins; a
different version is an error rather than a silent substitution.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SCROLLCASE_PIXI` | Path to the pixi executable, when not on `PATH`. A `--pixi` flag wins over it |
| `SCROLLCASE_CONDA_PACK` | Path to the conda-pack executable. A `--conda-pack` flag wins over it |
