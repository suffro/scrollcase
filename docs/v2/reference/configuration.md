# Workspace Configuration

Paths come from the project, not from Scrollcase. A `scrollcase.config.json` at the project root
declares where scrolls live and where Scrollcase writes what it builds; the CLI discovers it by
walking up from the working directory, so every command works from anywhere inside the project.

A project that declares nothing gets sensible defaults — the config file exists for projects that
already keep their scrolls elsewhere, or that adopted Scrollcase after building their own
convention.

## The file

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "paths": {
    "scrolls": "scrolls",
    "build": ".scrollcase/build",
    "dist": ".scrollcase/dist",
    "keys": ".scrollcase/keys",
    "toolchain": ".scrollcase/toolchain"
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | What lives there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `paths.scrolls` | `scrolls` | One directory per box, then one per target; each target holds `scroll.json`, `pixi.toml`, and the committed `pixi.lock` |
| `paths.build` | `.scrollcase/build` | Payload scratch space, wiped and regenerated on every build |
| `paths.dist` | `.scrollcase/dist` | Built artefacts under publish-ready `boxes/` and `channels/` trees |
| `paths.keys` | `.scrollcase/keys` | Local signing keys (`signing-private.pem`, `signing-public.json`) |
| `paths.toolchain` | `.scrollcase/toolchain` | `pixi` and `conda-pack`, when `init` installed them for the project |

Rules:

- `version` is optional, but when present must be `1`.
- Every `paths` entry is optional; an omitted entry falls back to its default.
- Unknown `paths` keys, non-string values, and malformed JSON are hard errors — a typo fails
  loudly rather than being silently ignored behind defaults.
- Relative paths in the config resolve **against the project root** (the config's directory), so
  the file is portable across machines and checkouts.

Commit the config and the scrolls; never commit `.scrollcase/` (build state and artefacts are
regenerated, and the private key must not enter history — `init` writes the ignore rules for
you).

## Discovery and precedence

The project root is chosen with this precedence, highest first:

1. `--project-root <dir>` — treat this directory as the root.
2. The directory of an explicit `--config <file>`. A named config that does not exist is a hard
   error.
3. The nearest `scrollcase.config.json` found walking up from the working directory.
4. The working directory itself (defaults apply).

Each individual path is then resolved with its own precedence, highest first:

1. **CLI flag** — `--scrolls-dir`, `--build-dir`, `--out-dir`, `--keys-dir`,
   `--toolchain-dir`. Flag values resolve
   against the **current working directory**, which is what a shell user expects.
2. **Config value** — resolves against the **project root**.
3. **Built-in default** — resolves against the project root.

| Flag | Overrides |
| --- | --- |
| `--config <file>` | Use this workspace config explicitly |
| `--project-root <dir>` | Treat this directory as the project root |
| `--scrolls-dir <dir>` | `paths.scrolls` |
| `--build-dir <dir>` | `paths.build` |
| `--out-dir <dir>` | `paths.dist` |
| `--keys-dir <dir>` | `paths.keys` |
| `--toolchain-dir <dir>` | `paths.toolchain` |

## Examples

Run against the example scrolls shipped in the Scrollcase repository, from your own project:

```sh
scrollcase build hello-box/macos-aarch64-metal --scrolls-dir ../scrollcase/examples
```

A monorepo that keeps packaging assets under `packaging/`:

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "paths": {
    "scrolls": "packaging/scrolls",
    "build": "packaging/.build",
    "dist": "packaging/dist",
    "keys": "packaging/keys"
  }
}
```

Note that the git checkout the build records its provenance from is the **project root** — the
box's `builderRevision` is the HEAD of the repository the workspace resolves to.

## The toolchain pin {#toolchain}

When [`init` installs the toolchain](/v2/reference/cli#the-toolchain-step) it adds a `toolchain`
block recording the digest it verified:

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "paths": { "…": "…" },
  "toolchain": {
    "pixi": {
      "version": "0.73.0",
      "assets": {
        "pixi-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz": "63e7cc91ef10eda71765c42e951362a084b2cbcbc93fb55c375c4f3acbfd7d00"
      }
    },
    "condaPack": {
      "version": "0.9.2"
    }
  }
}
```

**Commit this block.** The pixi entry records the release digest: the first install trusts the
checksum published beside the release, and every install after it is checked against the value
recorded here. One pixi asset entry accumulates per host, so a mixed-platform team gets one digest
per host asset. The conda-pack entry records the exact package release the managed installer asks
pixi to install.

Scrollcase writes the block itself; you never have to author it. To change Pixi intentionally,
edit the scroll's `pixiVersion`, install that exact release with consent, relock, rerun the licence
audit, review the changes, and rebuild. Removing `.scrollcase/toolchain/` only removes managed
executables; it does not erase the committed pin or make a floating resolver acceptable.
