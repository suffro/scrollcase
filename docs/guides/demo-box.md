# Box-run demo

<big> **Run a demo box easily, without installing any toolchain** </big>

## Try it now

Run a real Scrollcase box directly in your browser.  
No local installation, Docker setup, Pixi or Conda required.

## Local setup

Building a box needs pixi and conda-pack. But **consuming does not**: <br>
If you only want to see what a box is, and how to run it, try this public demo.
> You can find the demo box **GitHub release** [here](https://github.com/suffro/scrollcase/releases/tag/demo-box-v1).

### Downloads

Download the demo for your system:

|macOS (Metal)|Linux (CPU)|Windows (CPU)|
|--|--|--|
|[`macos-aarch64-metal`](https://github.com/suffro/scrollcase/releases/download/demo-box-v1/hello-box-1.0.0-macos-aarch64-metal.zip)|[`linux-x86_64-cpu`](https://github.com/suffro/scrollcase/releases/download/demo-box-v1/hello-box-1.0.0-linux-x86_64-cpu.zip)|[`windows-x86_64-cpu`](https://github.com/suffro/scrollcase/releases/download/demo-box-v1/hello-box-1.0.0-windows-x86_64-cpu.zip)|


::: tip NOTE

The file you download (eg. <samp>hello-box-1.0.0-macos-aarch64-metal.zip</samp>) is **NOT** the demo box — it is a container, named so you can tell which machine it is for, holding the box together with two ready-to-run examples.

The demo box is the <samp>.zip</samp> inside it under <samp>box/</samp>, next to its <samp>.release.json</samp>. Do not unzip that one: **it's ready to run**. Leave both named as they are and side by side, because that is how `verify` finds the box.

:::

### Run the box

Once you have downloaded the demo, follow these steps:

1. **Unpack the demo into a folder of its own:**

```sh
unzip hello-box-1.0.0-<target>.zip -d scrollcase-demo
cd scrollcase-demo
```

> **box/** holds 2 files: the **demo box** `.zip` to run, and its matching `.release.json`. Beside it
> you already have `run-box.ts` and `run_box.py` — nothing to retype. <br>

---

2. **Download the demo public key, next to the box rather than inside it:**

```sh
mkdir keys
curl -o keys/example-signing-public.json \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suffro/scrollcase/main/examples/keys/example-signing-public.json
```

or alternatively here's its GitHub link: [`example-signing-public.json`](https://github.com/suffro/scrollcase/blob/main/examples/keys/example-signing-public.json) 

::: tip Why the key lives outside the box
A signature only proves where something came from if the key does not travel with it. Keeping the
key in its own folder — and downloading it from the repository rather than the release — is the
habit to carry into a real project, where the key will not be a demo key.

3. **Verify and run the box:**

<Tabs :titles="['Terminal', 'Node/Python']">
<Tab title="Terminal">

This path needs the CLI, and nothing else — no pixi, no conda-pack, no build:

```sh
npm install -g scrollcase
```

<Tabs :titles="['macOS / Linux', 'Windows (PowerShell)']">
<Tab title="macOS / Linux">

```sh
scrollcase verify box/*.release.json --public-key keys/example-signing-public.json
scrollcase run    box/*.release.json --public-key keys/example-signing-public.json
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">

```powershell
scrollcase verify (Get-ChildItem box\*.release.json).FullName --public-key keys\example-signing-public.json
scrollcase run    (Get-ChildItem box\*.release.json).FullName --public-key keys\example-signing-public.json
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

> <small>The `box/*.release.json` above is a real shell glob, not a placeholder — your shell replaces
> it with the one release document in the folder. PowerShell does not expand globs for a command like
> this, which is why it needs `Get-ChildItem`. Either way you can always type the file name you see
> after unzipping. You never name the box archive: `verify` finds it beside the release document,
> under the hash that document commits to.</small>

#### What just happened

`verify` checks the signature, the archive's size and hash, the entry names and manifest agreement,
and works on any machine. `run` extracts the box to a temporary directory and executes its entry
point with the interpreter *inside* it — so it needs a machine matching the box's target. The box
output makes that outcome explicit instead of presenting its temporary extraction paths as the
demo:

```text
Hello from inside a Scrollcase box!

  signed -> verified -> relocated -> running

Success: the box's own Python runtime executed this program.
No dependencies were resolved or installed to make this run.

  Runtime  Python 3.11.15
  Host     Linux / x86_64
```

The final two lines reflect the box you downloaded and the matching machine running it.

<Tab title="Node/Python">


#### Run it from your own app

The CLI is the quickest way to see a box work, but an application does not shell out to it: every
consumer exposes the same verify-then-run semantics as a library. `run-box.ts` and `run_box.py` are
already in the folder you unpacked, so this is two commands, not a copy-paste.

<Tabs :titles="['Node', 'Python']">
<Tab title="Node">

```sh
npm install
npx tsx run-box.ts
```

::: details run-box.ts — the file you just ran
<<< @/../examples/demo-consumers/run-box.ts
:::

</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">

```sh
python -m pip install scrollcase-consumer
python run_box.py
```

::: details run_box.py — the file you just ran
<<< @/../examples/demo-consumers/run_box.py
:::

</Tab>
</Tabs>

`runBox` verifies the signature, extracts to a private temporary directory, executes, and cleans up
after itself — the same chain `scrollcase run` performs, minus the terminal. `onPrepared` fires
after verification and before execution, which is how an application shows what it is about to run
without repeating the trust chain itself.

Neither file names the box archive. Both find the release document by its suffix and let the
consumer resolve the archive beside it, under the hash that document commits to.

The Python package and the Rust crate are published separately: `npm install scrollcase` installs
neither, and `pip install scrollcase-consumer` or `cargo add scrollcase-consumer` needs no Node at
all. There is no Rust file in the folder, but the same two calls verify and run this same box from a
native application. Full surface in the [Library APIs reference](/reference/api).

::: warning The demo key is a demo key
Those boxes are signed with a key that exists only for the example. It signs nothing else and no
trust chain depends on it. A signature from it means the example is intact — nothing more.

4. **Check out the results, that's it.**

At this point the folder looks like this — the box untouched in its own directory, the key in
another, the runnable examples above both:

```text
scrollcase-demo/
├── box/                               # from the download, left exactly as it arrived
│   ├── <archive sha256>.zip
│   └── <document sha256>.release.json
├── keys/                              # step 2, from the repository — never from the release
│   └── example-signing-public.json
├── run-box.ts                         # from the download
├── run_box.py                         # from the download
├── package.json                       # from the download
└── README.md                          # from the download
```

Everything except `keys/` came out of the one file you downloaded. The key is the deliberate
exception, and the reason is above.
