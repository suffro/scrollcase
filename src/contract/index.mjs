/**
 * The Scrollcase box-format contract.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for what a box *is*: which targets exist, how a
 * target is named, which runtimes a box may declare and what each implies for the payload, and the
 * shape of every document a build emits. It ships three things that must never disagree — a
 * reference implementation (this code), a machine-readable spec (`schema/*.json`), and golden
 * fixtures (`fixtures/*.json`) that any other implementation can validate itself against.
 *
 * A consumer written in another language does not import this code; it mirrors the rules and proves
 * the mirror against the fixtures. That is how clients in other languages stay honest.
