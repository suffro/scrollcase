/**
 * `build` — assemble the environment, prove it works, archive it, sign it.
 *
 * In order: solve and pack the conda-forge environment from the committed lock, fetch and unpack the
 * declared assets, prune what is not needed at run time, audit dependency licences, self-test with
 * the payload's *own* interpreter, normalise timestamps, zip deterministically, and emit a signed
 * release plus a signed channel pointer.
 *
 * The self-test is the step that earns the box its name. The builder runs target, import, optional
 * Python-code, and file assertions; the release signs the import subset that a consumer can repeat
 * after extraction. The distinction is deliberate rather than pretending the narrower consumer
 * check reproduces scroll-only assertions it cannot see.
 *
 * The archive is content-addressed by its own hash, so the release document can commit to it and any
 * consumer can verify it byte for byte.
