 *
 * Reading: nothing from inside an archive is trusted before it is validated. Entry names are
 * checked against path traversal, links and special entries are rejected outright, and both ZIP
 * and TAR are handled by pinned Node implementations rather than whatever tools the host happens
 * to have — an archive behaves the same on every machine that opens it.
