/**
 * pixi + conda-forge builder helpers.
 *
 * This module owns the deterministic, side-effect-free pieces (tool discovery and exact argument
 * vectors) so they can be unit-tested; the orchestration that actually installs and packs a
 * prefix lives below in installAndPackPixiEnvironment, composed with an injected runner.
 *
 * Relocation model: build the env with pixi from the committed pixi.lock, pack it with
 * conda-pack, and extract it into the box as `venv/`. conda-pack already rewrites the build
 * prefix to a neutral placeholder, and a conda-forge prefix imports and runs from any location
 * with **no activation environment and no relocation fixer** (proven cold on macOS and Windows,
 * CPU + GPU). So conda-unpack is deliberately never run: doing so would bake the build machine's
 * path into the shipped box. A box needs no relocation step at install time.
