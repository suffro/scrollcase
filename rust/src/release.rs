//! The signed release manifest, and the `box.json` that must agree with it.
//!
//! These types are the runtime shape check. Node and Python validate the same documents against the
//! canonical JSON schemas at runtime; this crate encodes those schemas as types instead, because the
//! schemas set `additionalProperties: false` almost everywhere and a typed `deny_unknown_fields`
//! parse says exactly that — while a JSON Schema evaluator for the eighteen keywords these schemas
//! actually use would be six hundred lines of validation logic whose failure mode is validating
//! *less* than it claims.
//!
//! *Almost* everywhere: [`Compatibility`] is the one object the schemas leave open, and the types
//! leave it open too. A typed parse is a faithful stand-in for a schema only where the schema is
//! closed, and reading `deny_unknown_fields` as the house style rather than as a per-object
//! statement is exactly how this crate once came to refuse releases the format defines as valid.
//!
//! The equivalence is not assumed. `tests/schema.rs` validates the same documents against the
//! bundled canonical schemas and asserts the two agree, so a type that drifts from its schema is a
//! red test rather than a silent divergence between implementations.
//!
//! What the types cannot express — patterns, non-empty strings, positive integers, and the
//! `weights`/`assets` co-requirement — is checked explicitly in [`ReleaseManifest::validate`].
