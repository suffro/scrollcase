//! Trusted keys, and the signature check every consumer path begins with.
//!
//! The *caller* decides which public keys it accepts, and that decision is the whole basis of every
//! guarantee below it. This crate never discovers a key, never fetches one, and never treats a key
//! shipped beside an archive as trusted because it arrived.
//!
//! Where those keys come from is the caller's business rather than this crate's, and the difference
//! is a security property, not an ergonomic one. A trust file on disk suits a command line, whose
//! operator is also its administrator. An application shipped to someone else's machine usually
//! wants the opposite: anchors compiled into the binary with `include_str!`, so that editing a file
//! cannot substitute a key, sign a box with it, and have the application accept the result. Both
//! reach verification as [`TrustAnchors`], and everything past this module sees the same resolved
//! slice — there is one verification path, not one per source.
//!
//! A document is accepted when **any one** of its signatures verifies against a trusted key. That is
//! what lets a document signed by both an outgoing and an incoming key stay valid across a rotation,
//! and it is why a signature naming an unknown key is skipped rather than treated as an attack — a
//! build that carries only one of the two keys must still be able to verify. Compiled-in anchors do
//! not change that rule, but they do change who pays for it: rotating a key an application carries
//! means releasing the application, so an application that may ever rotate should compile in the
//! bundle shape and not the single key.
