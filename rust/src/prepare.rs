//! Verification and durable preparation of a caller-supplied local box.
//!
//! A [`PreparedBox`] is deliberately opaque. Its accessors expose useful signed identity and audit
//! data, while the verified release and the root's filesystem identity stay private. A caller
//! therefore cannot construct something that looks prepared and use it to skip the trust chain before
//! execution — in Rust that is not a convention but a property of the type: the fields are private,
//! there is no public constructor, and the only values in existence came from a function that
//! performed the checks.
//!
//! `status` says which of the two producers minted a receipt, because they do not prove the same
//! thing. `Prepared` means the bytes came from an archive whose signed hash was checked in this
//! process. `Attached` means an existing directory was re-identified against a signed release with no
//! archive to check it against — and the receipt must not claim more than that.
