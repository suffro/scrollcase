//! Shell-free execution of a box this process has already verified.
//!
//! The verified release supplies the interpreter and the script or module identity; the caller
//! supplies only additional argument strings, streams, and environment values. Nothing is passed
//! through a shell, and the argument vector is built from signed metadata rather than from a command
//! string, so there is no point at which a name from a manifest could become a second command.
//!
//! **Signals are forwarded through a channel the caller owns, not through handlers this crate
//! installs.** A library that registered a process-wide `SIGINT` handler would silently displace the
//! handler of the application embedding it — in a desktop app that is a bug, not a feature. So the
//! seam is explicit: a caller that wants forwarding wires its own handler to a [`SignalSender`], and
//! a caller that does not gets a child that simply runs. The Node consumer takes the same shape
//! through an injectable `signalSource`; here the injection is the only form.
