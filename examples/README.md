## The published demo box

The same `hello-box` below is built and signed by CI for all three operating systems and attached to
the [`demo-box-v1` release](https://github.com/suffro/scrollcase/releases/tag/demo-box-v1), so it can
be verified and run without a toolchain. `keys/example-signing-public.json` is the public half of the
key those boxes are signed with.

That key exists **only for the demo**. It signs nothing else, no trust chain depends on it, and it is
not the key for any Scrollcase release. Its private half lives in a repository secret and is used by
`.github/workflows/demo-box.yml` alone — a Linux or Windows box cannot be built on a maintainer's
machine anyway, since conda-pack packs the host's own environment.

`demo-consumers/` holds what travels inside each published archive beside the box: `run-box.ts`,
`run_box.py`, a `package.json`, and a `README.md`, so unpacking a download gives a folder that
already runs three ways. The same files are embedded in
[the demo box guide](https://scrollcase.dev/demos/box-run-demo), which is why they live here rather
than in the page — documentation and shipped bytes cannot drift apart. The public key is never
copied in: a signature proves nothing if the key arrives in the same package as what it signs.

## `hello-box`

The smallest thing Scrollcase can build: a stdlib-only Python 3.11 environment from conda-forge,
packed into a relocatable box. No model weights, no assets, nothing to download beyond the
interpreter itself — so it exercises the whole pipeline in about a minute and produces an archive
small enough to inspect by hand.

Size varies more by platform than the identical scrolls suggest, which is worth seeing before you
size a real box:

| Target | Archive | Extracted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `macos-aarch64-metal` | 48 MB | 126 MB |
| `windows-x86_64-cpu` | 43 MB | 120 MB |
| `linux-x86_64-cpu` | 191 MB | 483 MB |

The same box is declared for three targets, one per supported operating system. Build the one that
matches the machine you are on; the other two are what the CI builds elsewhere.

| Scroll | conda subdir | Interpreter in the box |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hello-box/macos-aarch64-metal` | `osx-arm64` | `venv/bin/python` |
| `hello-box/linux-x86_64-cpu` | `linux-64` | `venv/bin/python` |
| `hello-box/windows-x86_64-cpu` | `win-64` | `venv/python.exe` |

Run it from the Scrollcase checkout, using `examples/` as the scrolls root:

```sh
scrollcase lock hello-box/macos-aarch64-metal --scrolls-dir examples
scrollcase keygen
scrollcase build hello-box/macos-aarch64-metal --scrolls-dir examples
scrollcase verify .scrollcase/dist/boxes/hello-box/1.0.0/macos-aarch64-metal/*.release.json --self-test
scrollcase run .scrollcase/dist/boxes/hello-box/1.0.0/macos-aarch64-metal/*.release.json
```

`verify --self-test` extracts the archive and imports `json` and `sqlite3` with the interpreter
*inside the box*, which is the check that matters: it proves the packed environment runs somewhere
other than where it was built. `run` then executes `entrypoint.py`, whose output leads with the
result a newcomer cares about and keeps the runtime evidence readable:

```text
Hello from inside a Scrollcase box!

  signed -> verified -> relocated -> running

Success: the box's own Python runtime executed this program.
No dependencies were resolved or installed to make this run.

  Runtime  Python 3.11.15
  Host     Linux / x86_64
```

The final two lines vary with the target. There is deliberately no temporary extraction path to
decode: reaching the entry point already means the consumer verified the signed box and started its
own relocated interpreter.

The committed `pixi.lock` pins the exact packages, so `build` installs rather than resolves and two
builds of the same commit produce byte-identical archives. `platforms` in `pixi.toml` must equal the
target's conda subdirectory — the middle column above — or the solve produces an environment that
cannot run on the machine the box is for.

`entrypoint.py` reaches the payload through `localFiles`, which carries its SHA-256: editing the
script without updating that hash fails the build rather than silently shipping something nobody
reviewed.

That hash is taken over the file's bytes, which is worth knowing on Windows. Git converts line
endings on checkout by default, and a file rewritten to CRLF no longer matches the hash the scroll
declares — the build stops with a mismatch on a checkout that looks perfectly clean. This repository
marks the affected paths in [`.gitattributes`](../.gitattributes); a project declaring its own
`localFiles` needs the same for the files it names.
